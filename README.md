This project utilizes jupyter notebook for initial data processing and forfostering rapid insights. It Follows up with a web map displaying the notebook products allowing for users to explore the data on their own in the comfort and adaptabiltiy of the browser-map environment.

The subject of the data is Deer harvest in Minnesota; Looking at historical yearly datasets and how the available data we have on the devestating Chronic Wasting Disease can be integrated to drive insights and potential action.

The Notebook has featues to automatically generate maps based on a folder of shapefiles. In this case, yearly deer harvest data is released as individual shapefiles, so theoretically when 2020 data available it can be placed in the 'notebooks/data/deer_harvest_shp' directory and the maps and stats for that year will be displayed in the notebook and web map.
